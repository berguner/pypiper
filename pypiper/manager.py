Pypiper is a python module with two components:
1) the PipelineManager class, and
2) other toolkits (currently just NGSTk) with functions for more specific pipeline use-cases.
The PipelineManager class can be used to create a procedural pipeline in python.

    Base class for instantiating a PipelineManager object,
    the main class of Pypiper.

    :param str name: Choose a name for your pipeline;
        it's used to name the output files, flags, etc.
    :param str outfolder: Folder in which to store the results.
    :param argparse.Namespace args: Optional args object from ArgumentParser;
        Pypiper will simply record these arguments from your script
    :param bool multi: Enables running multiple pipelines in one script
        or for interactive use. It simply disables the tee of the output,
        so you won't get output logged to a file.
    :param bool dirty: Overrides the pipeline's clean_add()
        manual parameters, to *never* clean up intermediate files automatically.
        Useful for debugging; all cleanup files are added to manual cleanup script.
    :param bool recover: Specify recover mode, to overwrite lock files.
        If pypiper encounters a locked target, it will ignore the lock and
        recompute this step. Useful to restart a failed pipeline.
    :param bool new_start: start over and run every command even if output exists
    :param bool force_follow: Force run all follow functions
        even if  the preceding command is not run. By default,
        following functions  are only run if the preceding command is run.
    :param int cores: number of processors to use, default 1
    :param str mem: amount of memory to use. Default units are megabytes unless 
        specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T]."
    :param str config_file: path to pipeline configuration file, optional
    :param str output_parent: path to folder in which output folder will live
    :param bool overwrite_checkpoints: Whether to override the stage-skipping
        logic provided by the checkpointing system. This is useful if the
        calls to this manager's run() method will be coming from a class
        that implements pypiper.Pipeline, as such a class will handle
        checkpointing logic automatically, and will set this to True to
        protect from a case in which a restart begins upstream of a stage
        for which a checkpoint file already exists, but that depends on the
        upstream stage and thus should be rerun if it's "parent" is rerun.
    :raise TypeError: if start or stop point(s) are provided both directly and
        via args namespace, or if both stopping types (exclusive/prospective
        and inclusive/retrospective) are provided.
